## Why learn this course?

Stanford CS108 teaches large-scale Object Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java. The course concentrates on OOP design, both in the internal structure of its projects and in the large pre-built OOP libraries they are built on. The course features individual homework projects exercising OOP techniques and culminating in a large final project.
